 * Vitest configuration for GuildPass Mobile.

 * Environment: "node" – the feature-hook tests don't need a DOM or RN bridge.
 * Component tests (tests/components.test.tsx) use @testing-library/react-native
 * which works in the node environment via react-test-renderer.
 *
 * Path aliases mirror tsconfig.json so imports using "@/" resolve correctly.
