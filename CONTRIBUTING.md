## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- pnpm (recommended) or npm
- Expo Go on a physical device, or Xcode/Android Studio for simulators

### Steps

```bash
# 1. Fork and clone
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/guildpass-mobile.git
cd guildpass-mobile

# 2. Install dependencies
pnpm install

# 3. Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env — set EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL if connecting to live guildpass-core

# 4. Initialize EAS (Optional for local development)
# If you plan to use EAS Build for testing your fork, you must initialize your own EAS project:
npx eas init --id <YOUR_PROJECT_ID>
# Or create a new one:
npx eas init

# 5. Start the Expo dev server
pnpm start

# 6. Open on device / simulator
pnpm ios      # iOS simulator
pnpm android  # Android emulator
# Or scan the QR code in Expo Go
```

## Branching & Commits

- Branch off `main`: `git checkout -b feat/short-description` or `fix/short-description`
- Conventional commits:
  - `feat: add membership expiry countdown screen`
  - `fix: correct role badge colour for admin`
  - `test: add unit tests for membership store`

  - `chore: upgrade Expo SDK to 51`

---

## Submitting a Pull Request

1. Push your branch to your fork.
2. Open a PR against `Adamantine-Guild/guildpass-mobile` on `main`.
3. Fill in the [PR template](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) completely.
4. Ensure these pass before submitting:

```bash
pnpm typecheck   # Must pass with no errors
pnpm lint        # Fix all reported issues
pnpm test:run    # All tests must pass
```

### PR Quality Expectations

- UI changes must include a screenshot or screen recording in the PR description.
- Use NativeWind (Tailwind) classes — no `StyleSheet.create` for new UI unless justified.
- New screens must handle loading, empty, and error states.
- New business logic must have at least one Vitest unit test.
- Avoid generated boilerplate comments that only restate imports, returns, variable bindings, or JSX structure. Keep comments for non-obvious domain rules, edge cases, TODOs with context, or implementation tradeoffs.
- Do not introduce native modules that break Expo Go compatibility without prior discussion.

---

## Review Process

- A maintainer will review your PR within **5 business days**.
- Mobile PRs with UI changes may require a screen recording.
- Address requested changes promptly.

## Communication

- GitHub Issues: preferred for task discussion and bug reports
- Contact: cerealboxx123@gmail.com
